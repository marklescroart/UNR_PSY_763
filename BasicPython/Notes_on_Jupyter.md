# Starting up jupyter / python

Remember, python code doesn't run by itself. It requires a program - a python *interpreter* - to run the code. There are several ways to tell the python interpreter on your computer to run your python code. In this class, we will principally be dealing with python through jupyter notebooks. We will describe some other, simpler ways to run python code below, just so you get a better sense of what's going on in jupyter. 

Jupyter notebooks run python interpreters within a web server. To start the web server, you usually call the "jupyter" program from the command line, thus: 

jupyter notebook

This starts the web server running, which allows you to access a web page that is hosted from the directory in which you invoked the `jupyter notebook` command above. 

You direct a web browser (say, firefox or chrome) to access that web server at some particular web address (for example, https://localhost:8888) or  and thus give you access to the functionality of python through a web browser.
