This function allows you to specify an axis along which to convolve the data (here, the 0th axis, aka the first or vertical axis). The syntax is a bit different than the numpy function - the specification of `mode` handles what values are assumed to be outside the timecourse of the stimulus, and the `origin` keyword argument specifies where the convolution kernel should be centered (0 is at the middle of the kernel, here the middle of the HRF; -11, here, is at the far left of the HRF (because the HRF is 22 units long, and half of 22 is 11). We specify -11 and not zero because the HRF is a DELAY in the signal, not a symmetrical filter, we want the effect of the convolution to occur AFTER events or deflections in the original stimulus model. \n",
