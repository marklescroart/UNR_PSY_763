    "# Demo of how to label images \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides code for labeling features in the Lotus Hill images experiment (called \"color_natims\") which is provided as example data in the folder `/unrshare/LESCROARTSHARE/IntroToEncodingModels/` on each of your cloud instances. The recommended workflow to label your own features is to ***COPY THIS NOTEBOOK*** to a new notebook, move that notebook to the `FinalProjects/` folder, and work there. You can run through the copied notebook to see how the labeler works, and then modify the code as appropriate for your own purposes. So long as you have ***MADE A COPY***, you will always have the original notebook to look back on if you mess something up. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the labeler to generate a design matrix for a regression analysis in your final project, you should END this notebook with the generation of that design matrix, save it, and load it in another notebook that contains your final project analyses. "
